**Vision:**
- Crowdsourcing mosquito pain index to assist CCVC in application planning
- Start on a next-generation platform for consistent data entry and management for CCVC
- Chart better, contextual, and historically significant values on current trap counts
- Combine user reporting WITH trap counts in 1 map

**Future goals:**
- Report a bite (mobile) 
- Mosquito Selfie (Stand for 2 minutes, picture of arms!)
- Report standing water (mobile) (photos upload)
- PUSH notifications for application times, when vehicles GPS equipped/aerial applications
- Report standing water application amounts (Employee)
- PUSH notifications for imminent application (requires GPS on vehicles)
- Nearest park mosquito index
- Mosquito Weather Forecasting (based on temperature and time since rainfall/soil moisture)
- Automated proactive treatment planning/routing
- Dynamic data collection feeding into average/max/std deviation accounts (LIVE!)
- Leaderboard/social interaction/stickers/badges for bite reporting

**Missing Data:**
- Integrate with weather data
- Integrate with phone GPS, worker tracking/application reporting/PUSH notification for 
- Ecological Zone/foliage/habitat/permeable surfaces
